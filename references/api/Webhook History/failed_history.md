# Failed History V1

### Overview

API Version

GETCopy

Requirement

Subscribed to any webhook event.

Expectation

Ideally, the Blibli webhook will send a callback message to your system if there is any action triggered. But there is a possibility that this callback message could not make it to your system due to any possible issues. By using this API, you will be informed when there are any retries and failures that occurred during the sending of the webhook callback message from Blibli`s system to yours.

Limitation

This API is capable of returning a maximum of 100 records in total.
